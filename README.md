NoChickenCombat
===============

Simple plugin to combat chickening out of combat situations.

Configurable so that it only tags a player on pvp, pve or every action.

Only permission so far:
- nochickencombat.exempt - Exempts a player from beeing punished for logging out in combat

Only punished players who leave! Does not puish players on server restart/laggout/connection reset!
